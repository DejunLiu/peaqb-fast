peaqb-fast: The faster version of peaqb
Akinori Ito, 2 April, 2015

This is the patched version of peaqb written by G. Gottardi 'oveRet'. 
The basic functionalty of this program is almost same as that of the original peaqb, except the calculation speed. Only one improvement is -c option, which tells peaqb to output the result in the CSV format.
